-- | This module exports helpers for working with FormlessI queries.
-- | Since many queries are used as actions and may involve injecting
-- | variants, these helpers are provided to remove any associated
-- | boilerplate. Prefer these over using data constructors from the
-- | FormlessI query algebra.

-- | form validates successfully.
submit :: ∀ form. Query form
submit = Submit

-- | Replace all form inputs with a new set of inputs, and re-initialize
-- | the form to a new state. Useful to set a new "initial state" for a form,
-- | especially when filling a form with data loaded asynchronously.
loadForm
  :: ∀ form
   . form Record InputField
  -> Query form
loadForm = LoadForm

-- | `initialize` as an action, so you don't need to specify a `Unit`
-- | result. Use to skip a use of `Halogen.action`.
loadForm_
  :: ∀ form
   . form Record InputField
  -> Query form
loadForm_ = LoadForm

-- | Perform two FormlessI actions in sequence. Can be chained arbitrarily.
-- | Useful when a field needs to modify itself on change and also trigger
-- | validation on one or more other fields, or when a modification on one
-- | field should also modify another field.
